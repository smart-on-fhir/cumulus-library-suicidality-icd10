## Usage

To install the module, run `pip install cumulus-library-suicidality-icd10`.

This will add a `cumulus-library-suicidality-icd10` study target to `cumulus-library`.

This study is built using SMART Cumulus:  
* [Cumulus Library](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/cumulus/library) templates for "SQL on FHIR"
* [Chart Review](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/cumulus/chart-review/) packages for subject matter experts to label "ground truth"
* [Propensity Score Matching](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/cumulus/library/statistics/propensity-score-matching.html) (PSM) to select "case matched comparators"
